# Chapter 3: Gazebo-Specific Physics and Models

## Overview

This chapter delves into Gazebo-specific physics features and model creation techniques, focusing on URDF and SDF formats for humanoid robot representation. Students will learn advanced physics parameter configuration, joint and link setup, and environmental physics simulation.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, students will be able to:
- Create and configure URDF and SDF models for humanoid robots
- Set up advanced physics parameters in Gazebo
- Configure complex joint and link systems
- Simulate environmental physics for realistic scenarios
