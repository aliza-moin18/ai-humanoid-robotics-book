# Chapter 4: Integration with Simulation

## Overview

This chapter covers how to integrate ROS 2 with simulation environments, particularly Gazebo. You'll learn how to connect ROS 2 nodes to simulated robots, test and debug with simulated robots, and transition from simulation to hardware.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
- Set up Gazebo simulation environment with ROS 2
- Connect ROS 2 nodes to simulated robots
- Test and debug robot applications in simulation
- Understand the transition process from simulation to hardware

## Structure

This chapter is organized into the following sections:
1. ROS 2 and Gazebo Integration
2. Testing with Simulated Robots
3. Debugging and Visualization
4. Simulation to Hardware Transition

## Getting Started

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have completed the previous chapters and have Gazebo installed in your ROS 2 environment.
