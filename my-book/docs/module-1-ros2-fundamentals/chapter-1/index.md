# Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Overview

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, the Robot Operating System version 2. ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software that provides services like hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, and package management.

In this chapter, you will learn about:
- The core architecture of ROS 2
- How to create and manage nodes
- The publish/subscribe communication model using topics
- Synchronous communication using services
- Configuration management using parameters

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes
- Implement publisher and subscriber nodes for data exchange
- Create and use service clients and servers
- Configure nodes using parameters

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line

## Structure

This chapter is organized into the following sections:
1. Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture
2. Nodes and Processes
3. Topics and Message Passing
4. Services and Parameters

## Getting Started

Begin with the first section to understand the core architecture of ROS 2 before moving on to implementation details.
