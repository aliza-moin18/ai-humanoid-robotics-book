# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the AI Robotics Technical Book: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). This module focuses on teaching you to understand and implement ROS 2 middleware for humanoid robot control, including nodes, topics, services, actions, Python integration, and URDF.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this module, you will be able to:
1. Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services, actions, parameters)
2. Implement basic ROS 2 components (publishers, subscribers, service servers/clients)
3. Interpret and modify URDF robot models and create launch files
4. Apply ROS 2 concepts to humanoid robot control scenarios
5. Navigate and utilize ROS 2 tools for debugging and introspection
6. Integrate ROS 2 with simulation environments for testing
7. Design distributed robot applications using ROS 2 architecture
8. Compare different ROS 2 QoS policies and select appropriate ones for various use cases

## Module Structure

This module is organized into five chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Introduction to ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
2. **Chapter 2: Advanced Communication Patterns** - Actions, QoS, launch files, and parameter management
3. **Chapter 3: Robot Description and Modeling** - Working with URDF for humanoid robots
4. **Chapter 4: Integration with Simulation** - Connecting ROS 2 to Gazebo simulation
5. **Chapter 5: Applied Robotics Projects** - Real-world applications of ROS 2 concepts

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts (helpful but not required)

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to establish a solid foundation in ROS 2 concepts before progressing to more advanced topics.
