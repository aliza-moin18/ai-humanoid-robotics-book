# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - Specification

## User Input

```
Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Goal:
Teach students advanced perception, navigation, and AI-powered control for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2.

Deliverables:
- Module overview (2–3 sentences)
- Learning outcomes (5–8)
- Chapters (4–6):
    • Chapter title
    • 2–3 sentence description
    • Key topics (Isaac Sim, synthetic data, Isaac ROS, VSLAM, navigation, sim-to-real techniques)
- Suggested flow: simulation → perception → planning → control
- Hardware/lab exercises (Omniverse, RTX GPUs)

Constraints:
- Only Module 3 content
- Technically accurate
- Source-grounded in official NVIDIA Isaac documentation
- Follow /sp.constitution
- No full lessons, only structure and topics
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive specification for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) with:

- 5 prioritized user stories covering simulation setup, perception systems, navigation, AI control, and sim-to-real transfer
- 10 functional requirements addressing all key aspects of the AI-robot brain module including Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, VSLAM, Nav2, and sim-to-real techniques
- 4 key entities defined (AI-Robot Brain System, Isaac Simulation Environment, Perception Processing Pipeline, Navigation Control Framework)
- 7 measurable success criteria with specific metrics for student achievement
- Quality validation checklist confirming specification completeness

The specification follows the required structure with user-focused requirements that are technology-agnostic in the success criteria, while still addressing all the technical topics specified in the requirements (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2, VSLAM, etc.) in the functional requirements.

## Outcome

Specification successfully created at specs/003-ai-robot-brain/spec.md and is ready for the planning phase.
