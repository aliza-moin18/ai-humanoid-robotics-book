# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Specification

## User Input

```
Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Goal:
Teach students how to simulate humanoid robots and environments using Gazebo and Unity, covering physics, sensors, and high-fidelity visualization.

Deliverables:
- Module overview (2–3 sentences)
- Learning outcomes (5–8)
- Chapters (4–6):
    • Chapter title
    • 2–3 sentence description
    • Key topics (Gazebo setup, physics simulation, URDF/SDF robot models, LiDAR/IMU/depth sensors, Unity visualization, human-robot interaction)
- Suggested flow: setup → physics → sensors → simulation projects
- Hardware/lab exercises for simulation

Constraints:
- Only Module 2 topics
- Accurate, reproducible, source-grounded (Gazebo & Unity docs)
- Follow /sp.constitution
- No full lessons, just structure and topics
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive specification for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) with:

- 5 prioritized user stories covering setup, physics simulation, sensor integration, project work, and hardware integration
- 10 functional requirements addressing all key aspects of the digital twin module
- 4 key entities defined (Digital Twin Simulation, Simulation Environment, Humanoid Robot Model, Sensor Integration System)
- 7 measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Quality validation checklist confirming specification completeness

The specification follows the required structure with user-focused requirements that are technology-agnostic in the success criteria, while still addressing all the technical topics specified in the requirements (Gazebo, Unity, physics, sensors, etc.) in the functional requirements.

## Outcome

Specification successfully created at specs/002-digital-twin-simulation/spec.md and is ready for the planning phase.
