# Chapter 2: Advanced Communication Patterns

## Overview

This chapter covers advanced communication patterns in ROS 2 beyond the basic publisher-subscriber model. You'll learn about actions for long-running tasks, Quality of Service (QoS) settings for controlling message delivery, launch files for managing complex systems, and advanced parameter management.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
- Implement action clients and servers for long-running tasks with feedback
- Configure Quality of Service settings for different communication requirements
- Create and use launch files to manage multi-node systems
- Implement advanced parameter management techniques

## Structure

This chapter is organized into the following sections:
1. Actions for Complex Tasks
2. Quality of Service (QoS) Settings
3. Launch Files and System Composition
4. Parameter Management (expanded from Chapter 1)

## Getting Started

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have completed Chapter 1 and understand basic ROS 2 concepts including nodes, topics, and services.
