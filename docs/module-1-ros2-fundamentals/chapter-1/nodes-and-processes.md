# Nodes and Processes

## Overview

In ROS 2, nodes are the fundamental unit of execution. They are processes that perform computation and communicate with other nodes through messages. This section will cover how to create, structure, and manage nodes in ROS 2.

## Creating a Node

In ROS 2, nodes are implemented as objects that can be contained within a process. A single executable can contain multiple nodes, which is different from ROS 1 where each node typically ran in its own process.

## Node Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a ROS 2 node includes several states and transitions that allow for more sophisticated management of robot systems.

## Best Practices

When creating nodes, consider the following best practices for optimal performance and maintainability.
