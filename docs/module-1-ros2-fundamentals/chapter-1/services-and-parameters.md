# Services and Parameters

## Overview

Services in ROS 2 provide synchronous communication between nodes using a request/response model. Parameters allow nodes to be configured at runtime. This section covers both concepts and their implementation.

## Services

Services allow one node to request information or action from another node and wait for a response.

## Parameters

Parameters are configuration values that can be set at runtime and accessed by nodes. They can be global to the system or specific to individual nodes.
