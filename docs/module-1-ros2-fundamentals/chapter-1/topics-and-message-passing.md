# Topics and Message Passing

## Overview

Topics in ROS 2 enable asynchronous communication between nodes using a publish/subscribe model. This section covers how to create topics, define messages, and implement publisher and subscriber nodes.

## Publisher-Subscriber Pattern

The publisher-subscriber pattern is a messaging pattern where senders (publishers) of messages are decoupled from receivers (subscribers) of messages.

## Message Types

ROS 2 provides several built-in message types and allows for custom message definitions to suit specific application needs.

## Quality of Service (QoS)

QoS settings allow you to control the delivery of messages between publishers and subscribers based on specific requirements for reliability, durability, and other factors.
