# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Overview

This module teaches students advanced perception, navigation, and AI-powered control for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2. The content follows the suggested flow: simulation → perception → planning → control, and includes hardware/lab exercises using Omniverse and RTX GPUs.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. Successfully install and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS environments
2. Implement VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems using Isaac tools
3. Integrate Isaac ROS with perception and navigation systems for humanoid robots
4. Implement Nav2 navigation systems for intelligent path planning and obstacle avoidance
5. Apply sim-to-real transfer techniques for AI models developed in simulation
6. Generate synthetic training data using Isaac Sim that results in AI models with 75%+ performance when applied to real-world scenarios
7. Demonstrate understanding of perception systems by implementing VSLAM that achieves 85% accuracy in environmental mapping tasks
8. Implement Nav2-based navigation systems that successfully complete path planning tasks in 90% of test scenarios

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following chapters:

- **Chapter 7**: NVIDIA Isaac Introduction
- **Chapter 8**: Vision and Navigation
- **Chapter 9**: Reinforcement Learning and Control
- **Chapter 10**: Advanced Perception Systems
- **Chapter 11**: Sim-to-Real Transfer Techniques

Each chapter includes theoretical concepts, practical implementation guidance, and lab exercises to reinforce learning outcomes.
