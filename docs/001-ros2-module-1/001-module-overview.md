# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

This module introduces students to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) middleware, focusing on its application in humanoid robot control. Students will learn to understand and implement core ROS 2 concepts including nodes, topics, services, actions, parameters, and the Python client library `rclpy`.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, students will be able to:
1. Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services, actions, parameters)
2. Implement basic ROS 2 components (publishers, subscribers, service servers/clients)
3. Interpret and modify URDF robot models and create launch files
4. Apply ROS 2 concepts to humanoid robot control scenarios
5. Navigate and utilize ROS 2 tools for debugging and introspection
6. Integrate ROS 2 with simulation environments for testing
7. Design distributed robot applications using ROS 2 architecture
8. Compare different ROS 2 QoS policies and select appropriate ones for various use cases

## Module Structure

This module is organized into 5 chapters that progress from fundamental concepts to applied robotics projects:

1. [ROS 2 Fundamentals](002-chapter-1-fundamentals.md) - Core concepts: nodes, topics, services
2. [Advanced Communication Patterns](003-chapter-2-advanced-patterns.md) - Actions, QoS, launch files, parameter management
3. [Robot Description and Modeling](004-chapter-3-robot-modeling.md) - URDF fundamentals and robot models
4. [Integration with Simulation](005-chapter-4-simulation-integration.md) - ROS 2 and Gazebo integration
5. [Applied Robotics Projects](006-chapter-5-applied-projects.md) - Complete ROS 2 applications

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts (helpful but not required)

## Required Software

To complete the exercises in this module, you will need:
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill (or latest LTS version)
- Gazebo Classic or Ignition Gazebo
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git version control system
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

## Navigation

You can navigate through the module using the sidebar or proceed directly to the [first chapter](002-chapter-1-fundamentals.md) to begin learning about ROS 2 fundamentals.
