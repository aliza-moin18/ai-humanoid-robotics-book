# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview
Welcome to Module 1 of the AI Robotics Technical Book. This module focuses on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) fundamentals for humanoid robot control. You will learn how to understand and implement ROS 2 middleware, including nodes, topics, services, actions, parameters, and the Python integration (rclpy).

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this module, students will be able to:
1. Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services, actions, parameters)
2. Implement basic ROS 2 components (publishers, subscribers, service servers/clients)
3. Interpret and modify URDF robot models and create launch files
4. Apply ROS 2 concepts to humanoid robot control scenarios
5. Navigate and utilize ROS 2 tools for debugging and introspection
6. Integrate ROS 2 with simulation environments for testing
7. Design distributed robot applications using ROS 2 architecture
8. Compare different ROS 2 QoS policies and select appropriate ones for various use cases

## Module Structure
This module is organized into five chapters:

- **Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Introduction to ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- **Chapter 2: Advanced Communication Patterns** - Advanced ROS 2 communication mechanisms
- **Chapter 3: Robot Description and Modeling** - Working with URDF and robot models
- **Chapter 4: Integration with Simulation** - Connecting ROS 2 to simulation environments
- **Chapter 5: Applied Robotics Projects** - Real-world applications of ROS 2 concepts

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
