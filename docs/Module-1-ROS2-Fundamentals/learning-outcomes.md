# Learning Outcomes: Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This document defines the 8 measurable learning outcomes for Module 1 as required by the specification.

## Outcome 1: Explain Core ROS 2 Concepts
**Description:** Students will be able to articulate the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 including nodes, topics, services, actions, and parameters.

**Assessment Method:** Written quiz with definitions and explanations of each concept; oral examination of student understanding.

## Outcome 2: Implement Basic ROS 2 Components
**Description:** Students will be able to implement basic ROS 2 components such as publishers, subscribers, service servers, and clients using Python (rclpy).

**Assessment Method:** Practical lab exercises where students create working examples of each component type.

## Outcome 3: Interpret and Modify URDF Robot Models
**Description:** Students will be able to read, interpret, and modify URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) robot models and create launch files.

**Assessment Method:** Lab exercises requiring students to modify existing URDF files and create launch files to start robot simulations.

## Outcome 4: Apply ROS 2 Concepts to Robot Control
**Description:** Students will be able to apply ROS 2 concepts to humanoid robot control scenarios by designing and implementing appropriate communication patterns between robot subsystems.

**Assessment Method:** Project where students create a complete ROS 2 application that controls a simulated humanoid robot.

## Outcome 5: Navigate ROS 2 Tools for Debugging
**Description:** Students will be proficient in using ROS 2 tools for debugging and introspection, including rqt, ros2 topic, ros2 service, and other command-line tools.

**Assessment Method:** Practical exercises where students must diagnose and fix problems in provided ROS 2 code using debugging tools.

## Outcome 6: Integrate ROS 2 with Simulation
**Description:** Students will be able to connect ROS 2 nodes to simulation environments, particularly Gazebo, for testing and validation.

**Assessment Method:** Lab exercise requiring integration of ROS 2 nodes with a Gazebo simulation and validation of functionality.

## Outcome 7: Design Distributed Robot Applications
**Description:** Students will be able to design distributed robot applications using ROS 2 architecture principles, considering communication patterns, message design, and system composition.

**Assessment Method:** Design exercise where students plan a complete robot application architecture using ROS 2 concepts.

## Outcome 8: Apply QoS Policies Appropriately
**Description:** Students will be able to compare different ROS 2 Quality of Service (QoS) policies and select appropriate ones for various use cases.

**Assessment Method:** Scenario-based assessment where students must justify their choice of QoS settings for different communication requirements.
