# Chapter 2: Physics Simulation Fundamentals

## Overview

This chapter introduces students to the fundamental concepts of physics simulation in the context of digital twin applications for humanoid robots. Students will learn about physics engines, rigid body dynamics, collision detection, and parameter tuning to achieve realistic robot movements.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, students will be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of physics simulation in Gazebo
- Configure physical properties for humanoid robot models
- Implement collision detection and response systems
- Tune parameters for realistic movement in simulation

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into the following sections:

1. [Section 2.1: Gazebo Physics Engine Concepts](./chapter-2/section-2-1-gazebo-physics-concepts)
2. [Section 2.2: Creating Physical Properties for Humanoid Robots](./chapter-2/section-2-2-physical-properties)
3. [Section 2.3: Collision Detection and Response](./chapter-2/section-2-3-collision-detection)
4. [Section 2.4: Parameter Tuning for Realistic Movement](./chapter-2/section-2-4-parameter-tuning)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, students should have:
- Completed Chapter 1: Environment Setup
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (force, mass, acceleration)
- Familiarity with 3D coordinate systems
