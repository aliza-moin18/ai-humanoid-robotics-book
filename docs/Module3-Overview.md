# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Module Overview

This module teaches students advanced perception, navigation, and AI-powered control for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2. Students will learn to develop sophisticated AI systems that enable humanoid robots to perceive their environment, navigate complex spaces, and execute intelligent behaviors using GPU-accelerated processing.

The module follows the suggested flow: simulation → perception → planning → control, providing students with hands-on experience using Omniverse and RTX GPUs. Students will progress from basic simulation setup through advanced AI control systems and sim-to-real transfer techniques.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. Understand the NVIDIA Isaac platform and its components (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2)
2. Implement vision-based navigation systems using VSLAM techniques
3. Apply reinforcement learning techniques for robot control and behavior learning
4. Perform sim-to-real transfer of trained models with minimal performance degradation
5. Integrate Isaac components with ROS 2 systems for comprehensive robot functionality
6. Create cognitive robot behaviors using Isaac tools and AI techniques
7. Optimize AI models for edge deployment on Jetson hardware platforms
8. Design complete AI-robot brain systems that integrate perception, navigation, and control
